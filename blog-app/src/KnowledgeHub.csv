21,REACT,"Mismatched Braces, Parentheses, or Brackets","Mismatched Braces, Parentheses, or Brackets","In this scenario, a syntax error occurs because there is a missing closing parenthesis in the console.log statement."
22,REACT,Missing Semicolons,Missing Semicolons,JavaScript uses semicolons to separate statements. Omitting them can lead to syntax errors.
