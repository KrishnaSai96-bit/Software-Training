Message: 'INGREDIENTS': '1 teaspoon Cumin powder (Jeera),5 cloves Garlic - finely chopped,1/2 cup Coriander (Dhania) Leaves - chopped,1 Cucumber - peeled and grated,Salt - to taste,1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour,1/2 cup Gram flour (besan),1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania),1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder,2 Green Chillies - finely chopped,1/4 cup Rice flour,1 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi),Ghee - for smearing on thalipeeth' 'RECIPE_STEPS': 'To begin making the Maharashtrian Kakdi Thalipeeth Recipe, in a large mixing bowl add all the 3 flours together and mix them.\nAdd all the remaining ingredients like the grated cucumber, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, green chillies, coriander leaves, garlic and salt to taste.Mix everything well and add a little water at a time to make a smooth and firm dough of the Kakdi Thalipeeth.\nThe cucumber will release water when it gets combined with salt, so take care to add little water at a time.\nThe dough will be slightly sticky to handle.\nAllow the dough to rest for 5 minutes.\nDivide the dough into 4 portions.\nPreheat the skillet on medium heat.\nKeep water in a separate bowl to wet fingers and to wet a muslin cloth.Spread a wet muslin cloth on a smooth counter top.\nTake a portion of the Kakdi Thalipeeth mixture and pat it on the wet cloth to about 4 inches in diameter.\nTry not to make it too thin as it can break while flipping it on the skillet.Carefully lift the cloth along with the patted mixture and flip the Thalipeeth over on the skillet.\nDrizzle a teaspoon of oil or ghee around the Thalipeeth and cook on medium heat.After about 3 minutes, you will be able to flip the Kakdi Thalipeeth over to the other side.\nAllow each side to cook on medium heat for about 3-4 minutes, until the Thalipeeth are slightly crisp and browned.\nRemove from heat and place on a serving platter.Continue the same procedure with the other portions of the Kakdi Thalipeeth dough.Serve the Maharashtrian Kakdi Thalipeeth along with Homemade Yogurt or lahsun chutney for breakfast.'
